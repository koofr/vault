https://vault.koofr.net

Koofr Vault is an open-source, client-side encrypted folder for your Koofr cloud storage offering an extra layer of security for your most sensitive files. The encryption is compatible with [rclone](https://rclone.org/).

## Tech stack

Koofr Vault is divided into two parts: the engine and the UI. The engine, made up of `vault-core` and `vault-wasm`, is written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly. The UI, `vault-web`, is written in React and uses Vite for frontend tooling. There is no server component; Koofr Vault only uses the public Koofr REST API.

## Build and run locally

The easiest way to run Koofr Vault locally is to build and run it with Docker. This will compile the app and build a Docker image using [Caddy web server](https://caddyserver.com/).

```sh
docker build --build-arg GIT_REVISION=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) -t vault .

docker run --rm -p 5173:5173 vault
```

You can now open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

### Build static files

Alternatively, you can build static files, which will produce `vault-web.tar.gz` file with the static files:

```sh
docker build --build-arg GIT_REVISION=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) --build-arg GIT_RELEASE=$(git describe --tags --exact-match 2> /dev/null || echo -n '') --target static-stage -t vault-static .

docker run --rm vault-static cat vault-web.tar.gz > vault-web.tar.gz
```

## Development

For development instructions, see the [`vault-wasm` README](./vault-wasm/README.md) and [`vault-web` README](./vault-web/README.md).

## Reproducibility

Koofr Vault is built using GitHub Actions and published as a GitHub Release. You can download a release `.tar.gz` file and run it locally, or use the extracted files from the release to verify what https://vault.koofr.net is serving. The current deployed Git revision can be found at https://vault.koofr.net/gitrevision.txt


Example:

```sh
mkdir koofr-vault-check
cd koofr-vault-check

wget https://github.com/koofr/vault/releases/download/v0.1.0/vault-web.tar.gz

tar xf vault-web.tar.gz

allok=true

for path in $(tar tf vault-web.tar.gz | grep -v './$' | sort); do
  local=$(sha256sum "$path" | awk '{print $1}')
  remote=$(curl -s "https://vault.koofr.net/${path:2}" | sha256sum | awk '{print $1}')
  if [ "$local" = "$remote" ]; then
    echo "$path OK"
  else
    echo "$path MISMATCH (local $local remote $remote)"
    allok=false
  fi
done

if [ "$allok" = "true" ]; then
  echo "OK"
else
  echo "MISMATCH"
fi
```
